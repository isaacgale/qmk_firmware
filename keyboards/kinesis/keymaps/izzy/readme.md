# izzy's Programmer Dvorak

Bascially an updated version of Jwon's layout with new QMK features eg. Key Overrides and Caps Word to replace needing a RAISE layer (for my needs at least).
I also prefer different thumb cluster layouts.

[Jwon's Programmer Dvorak] (https://www.jwon.me/programmers-dvorak/)

Loosely based off [Programmer Dvorak](https://www.kaufmann.no/roland/dvorak/) and ThePrimeagen's [Real Programmers Dvorak](https://github.com/ThePrimeagen/keyboards)

## Requirements
* The Stapelberg mod, personally compiled with QMK 0.23.0
